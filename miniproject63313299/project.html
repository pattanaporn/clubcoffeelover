    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>Coffee varieties There are many varieties of coffee in the world. But generally known, there are 4 varieties:</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify"><b>Arabica :</b>   People who love the mellow, aroma and smooth taste of coffee. Always fall in love with this coffee. It is 80 percent of the world's most popularly grown coffee and is the most popular coffee in fresh coffee shops around the world. At the same time, Arabica is difficult to grow and requires a lot of quality control of planting. Arabica has a mild caffeine content of 1.1-1.7% and is available in a variety of varieties such as Tripica, Bourbon, Blue Mountain Mokka, Catura Kona and Kent, which has a different aroma and sweet taste depending on the origin. Arabica is a coffee that loves cool weather around 15-25 degrees, so it is suitable for growing in the terrain above 1,000. meters above sea level And of course, the price of coffee varies according to the quality of each species as well.</p>
<p class="w3-justify"><b>Robusta :</b>   Strong coffee lovers like real men should not miss Robusta coffee. Because it has a concentration of caffeine up to 2-4.5 percent and the body (concentration) also gives a more astringent flavor than Arabica with a intensity that is twice as high as Robusta, making it popular to produce instant coffee. (Instant Coffee) and 3in1 days when you have to travel long distances or want your body to be alert all day. Just choose your own Robusta coffee, ready to go all the way. Including mixing with other coffee species called "Blend Coffee" (Blend Coffee) that Robusta is easy to care for, easy to grow, loves the hot and humid climate of our southern country, strong, resistant to various diseases as well. High yield and easy maintenance.</p>
<p class="w3-justify"><b>Excelsa :</b>   Despite the appearance of the seeds and the taste is close to Robusta. But Excelsa is not as popular as Robusta. But if you try asking Africans and coffee's birthplace (Coffee was first discovered in Yemen and Ethiopia. The Excelsa was first introduced in 1904.) They loved the rich and bitter taste of Excelsa very much. To the extent that this coffee can be enjoyed all day long, it is easy to grow, easy to care for, drought and disease resistant, high yielding, and the mature seeds of Excelsa also have a mellow and aromatic flavor similar to Arabica coffee.</p>
<p class="w3-justify"><b>Liberica :</b>  Liberica's hometown is in Liberia and the Ivory Coast. The taste is similar to Arabica but has a more sweet and sour taste of berries. But it is more resistant to disease. Loves hot and humid weather. In addition, Ivory Coast and Madagascar people also like to develop varieties with other coffee varieties. Baristas also like to blend it with other coffees. To increase the concentration and enhance the flavor to be more unique. Despite being known as a coffee that is of lower quality than other species But Liberica is gaining popularity in Scandinavian countries.</p>
